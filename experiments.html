      <p class="micro_obj">
        Mechanical properties of caprock are important for subsurface energy sequestration as they determine the rock
        stability under the influence of external forces. Despite some advantages, there is a lack of knowledge
        regarding
        the interplay between rock texture and mechanical properties and their impact on the caprock stability within a
        short-term fluid-rock reaction period. Typical caprock samples from the Mercia Mudstone Group in the East Irish
        Sea Basin are studied in this work. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with
        energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to identify minerology and local heterogeneity
        characteristics.
        Nanoindentation tests were conducted before and after CO2-brine-rock reaction to investigate the changes of
        micro-mechanical properties. After CO2-brine treatment, significant dolomite dissolution was observed in all
        samples (although dolomite content was only minor in some samples). In contrast, the micro-texture of other
        minerals showed no significant changes indicating minimal to no dissolution at the current resolution. The
        changes of mechanical properties are lower than expected, which are probably related to the impaired cementation
        induced by the retained water in pore throats and relatively rough surface after reaction. For long-term
        carbon sequestration, the layered depositional characteristics of different phases may not only form a barrier
        to prevent fluids leaking upward, but also complement each other in mechanical properties to maintain stability.
        This study improves the understanding of the effect of microscale structural and micro-mechanical changes on
        caprock stability in carbon sequestration related applications.

      <p class="micro_obj">
        The mineralogical development and diagenetic sequence of lacustrine shales in the Chang 7 Member of
        the Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin are detailed studied. A model of their depositional system
        and a diagenetic diagram are proposed in this study. Through detailed petrographic, mineralogical, and
        elemental analyses, four distinct shale types are identified: argillaceous shale, siliceous shale, calcareous
        shale, and carbonate, clay, and silt-bearing shale. The main diagenetic process in argillaceous shale is the
        transformation of illite to smectite, negatively impacting shale porosity. Siliceous shale undergoes carbonate
        cementation and quartz dissolution, contributing to increased porosity, particularly in mesopores.
        Calcareous shale experiences diagenesis characterised by carbonate formation and dissolution, with a
        prevalence of siderite. In carbonate, clay, and silt-bearing shale, the dissolution of K-feldspar contributes
        to illitization of kaolinite. Argillaceous shale, characterised by more clay minerals and lower mesopore
        volume, is identified as a potential hydrocarbon seal. Siliceous shale, with the highest pore volume and
        abundant inter-mineral pores, emerges as a promising shale oil reservoir. These findings contribute to a
        comprehensive understanding of shale properties, aiding in the prediction of shale oil exploration potential in
        the studied area.

      <p class="micro_obj">
        Assessing caprock integrity is crucial for safe geological carbon storage. This
        study investigates caprock-acid interactions at micro-scale, utilising time-lapse 3D
        imaging and simulation, representing CO2 injection scenarios. The interaction induced
        initial pre-existing fracture closure in mudstones, followed by fracture growth and
        sample swelling. Acid predominantly followed pathways in fractures along laminations.
        Reactive transport models showed dissolution predominantly occurring near the inlet,
        driven by a decrease in H+
        concentration along fluid pathways. Carbonate distribution
        controlled dissolved volume, with calcite dissolution and acid migration rates
        decreasing over time. Simulation indicated reduced shear stress after acid injection, especially with low-pH
        acids, resulting in slower fluid flow. Slower acid movement
        and prolonged presence in immobile fluid flow zones led to more extensive calcite
        dissolution compared to mobile zones. This study provides valuable insights into
        microstructural evolution in caprock following CO2 injection, emphasising the potential
        risk of fracture development and leakage.
